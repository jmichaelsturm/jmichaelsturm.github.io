Thank you for visiting my personal website! I hope you enjoy reading about my background and many interests and hobbies.

I grew up in [Bartlesville, Oklahoma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartlesville,_Oklahoma) and now live in [Edmond, Oklahoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond,_Oklahoma) with my wife and three children. I studied [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.okstate.edu/) at [Oklahoma State University](https://go.okstate.edu/) in Stillwater, Oklahoma, earning B.S., M.S., and Ph.D degrees.  My graduate work focused on using numerical techniques to study radar scattering from rough surfaces.

Currently I am a Principal Firmware Engineer with [Neubloc](https://www.neubloc.com/) as a contractor for a leading hard disk drive company.
