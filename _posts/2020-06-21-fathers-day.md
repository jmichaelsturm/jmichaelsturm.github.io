For my brother Mark and I, this is our first Father's Day without Dad, who passed away in March.
Over the course of many years Alzheimer's Disease slowly robbed our family of Dad's full presence.
At first it slightly diminished his exceptional intellect, giving the rest of us a fighting chance
to win an occasional round of Liverpool Rummy. As it progressed, this horrible illness stole his
words and deprived him of the ability to recount humorous stories from his childhood and verbal
expressions of his love for us. Ultimately it claimed his life, long before it should have ended.

Nevertheless, Alzheimer's Disease cannot and will not steal our memories of a man who humbly and
honorably taught two boys how to be an excellent father through his consistent example.

I hope each of you enjoys Father's Day as much as I enjoy _remembering summers with Dad_.

## Outdoor adventures

Dad loved spending time outside and shared his enthusiasm with us each summer, guiding
us as we explored various outdoor hobbies and sports. A gifted athlete himself, Dad was skilled in
baseball, basketball, golf and many other sports. I appreciate how he encouraged us but never
forced us to play a particular sport. I have seen other fathers push their children to follow
in their footsteps in order to recapture their youth. Dad used a different approach.  He devoted
himself to helping us experience many new activities, such as showing us how to catch a fish
or how to hit a baseball.

**Dad is holding quite possibly the only fish I ever caught...**

Dad knew the best balance of encouragement and instruction to help us find our own hobbies and paths to success. I remember his kindness one time after I made a crucial mistake while running
the bases after a hit. I ran past second base to third and then found myself standing by my fellow
teammate at third base! Oops, where did he come from? I was easily tagged out as I ran back to
second. Upon my return to the dugout, I could hear other fathers grumbling about my costly gaffe.
Dad lovingly explained how to avoid that mistake in the future and, most importantly, assured me
that I was loved even in times of failure.

Each year, Dad and Granddad planted a large vegetable garden with rows of asparagus, okra,
pumpkins, watermelon, cantaloupe, green beans, and sometimes corn. When Mark and I were old enough
to help with manual labor, we joined them in the tasks of watering and pulling weeds in the garden
during the long, hot days of summer. At the time, both of us complained about this hard work, but
Dad knew that it would teach us deeper lessons about life itself - the value of working hard so
you can enjoy a harvest. I look back at this time fondly, and I credit those lessons learned
as the foundations of my own work ethic today.

**That glazed look after realizing you are going to pick a ton of vegetables...**

One of our favorite activities in the summer was playing golf at Adams Municipal Golf Course
in Bartlesville.  Granddad and Dad had many years of experience playing golf, and it showed.
Not only had they mastered the game, but they understood the subtle points of golf etiquette
which were often lost on Mark and me. They would kindly show us how to mark our ball position on
the green, how to repair divots, how to avoid walking on the green between the pin and another
player's ball, and how to yell "fore!" to warn other players when one of our shots went astray.
We learned the last skill very well. Golf strengthened our personal connections with Dad and
Granddad. We heard their stories about learning golf, celebrated (or more often _lamented_) the
current state of the Oklahoma State football program, and shared nuggets of wisdom and humor
as we walked the course together in the blazing Oklahoma sun.

## Hamburgers, ice cream, and slideshows

To me, the highlight of every summer undoubtedly was the celebration of Independence Day and the
coinciding visits by aunts, uncles, and cousins. Our house often became the hub for these family
reunions, and Mom and Dad were gracious hosts.  Mom always prepared her famous baked beans
and potato salad to go along with the best hamburgers west of the Mississippi. Dad had the honor
of grilling the burgers, perhaps with a little bit of help from his sons, and cranking (for what
seemed like hours) the homemade ice cream freezer. The food was fantastic, and laughter always
filled the house.

As the last bowls of ice cream were being consumed, Dad prepared the slide projector for the grand
finale - a photographic recap of our family's past year including birthdays, holidays, and
vacations. In the days of sharing photos on Instagram and Facebook, I now miss the quaint
click-click of the slide projector and the accompanying "oohs", "ahs" and laughter as we
celebrated another year with family. Dad's warm smiles indicated that knew the importance of family.

## Star-gazing and Star Trek

Summer days often concluded with star-gazing and Star Trek!

Dad, Mark, and I shared a love of astronomy and space exploration. As youth, we could not read
enough books about the stars and planets and often tuned-in to NASA television news conferences
in which scientists discussed the latest findings and spectacular images from space probes such as
Voyager (exploring Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and Viking (landing on Mars).

Dad encouraged our love of astronomy by buying us a small telescope which allowed us to view with
our own eyes what we had seen in photos and on television. Seeing the rings of Saturn and the moons
of Jupiter through a our small telescope sparked my imagination and cemented my decision to pursue
science or engineering as a career.

I will never forget how Dad made a way for us to see Halley's Comet in 1986. Early one morning
before sunrise he drove us several miles east of town armed with binoculars and star maps hoping to
get a glimpse of the famous visitor to the night sky. Although the comet was fuzzy and faint,
two boys and one father shared an amazing and unforgettable experience.

Our love of astronomy and space exploration extended into fiction as well, and I can remember
spending many late nights as a teenager with Dad and Mark watching the original Star Trek re-runs
on television. Although these shows may seem "campy" to viewers today, we recognized the strong
stories and relevant messages that apply outside of the realm of science fiction. As I recall,
these late night viewings led to some of the first deep discussions with Dad about many of the
problems and injustices that impact our world. Dad's values continue to shape my own.
