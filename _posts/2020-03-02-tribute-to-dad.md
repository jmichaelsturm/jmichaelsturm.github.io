My Dad, Gene Paul Sturm, Jr., of Bartlesville, OK passed away on March 2, 2020 after years of
struggle against Alzheimer's Disease. Below is my tribute to my father, friend, and mentor.
I will never forget him and his tremendous, positive impact on my life.

In the book of Matthew, Jesus teaches

> "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.
> This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as
> yourself."
>
> _Matthew 22:37-39 (NRSV)_

I know that my dad understood and believed these words by the way he lived his life.

Dad demonstrated his **love for God** not only through sharing his faith and values within our
family, but by recognizing the image of God in everyone and by marveling at the beauty of the
universe He created.

Dad demonstrated his **love for his neighbors** by selflessly serving his community, his friends,
and especially his family.  He practiced sacrificial love, putting his own needs below the needs
of those he loved.

I am a *thankful* recipient of Dadâ€™s love, and his values forever shaped me into the husband and
the father I am today.

I am *thankful* for a dad who always believed the best in people instead of the worst.

I am *thankful* for a dad who valued honesty and justice for those in society who were overlooked
and marginalized.

I am *thankful* for a dad who was brilliant but never made you feel any less.

I am *thankful* for a dad who taught that loving God and loving science are not mutually exclusive
but the truest expressions of knowledge.

I am *thankful* for a dad who believed in me as I pursued my educational and career dreams.

I am *thankful* for a dad who showed me how to treat family and friends with unrelenting love and
respect.

I am *thankful* for a dad who loved my wife like his own daughter and who had overflowing love and
pride for his grandchildren.

But I am mostly *thankful* for a dad who taught me to **love God and love others** - the values I
need to live my life.

I will miss Dad until I see him in Heaven, but I know that I carry his values with me every day.
