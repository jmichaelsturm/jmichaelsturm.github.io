For my brother Mark and I, this is our first Father's Day without Dad, who passed away in March.
Over the course of many years Alzheimer's Disease slowly robbed our family of Dad's full presence
long before his death in March.  At first it only slightly diminished his exceptional intellect,
giving the rest of us a fighting chance to win an occasional round of Liverpool Rummy. As it
progressed, this horrible illness stole his words and deprived him of the ability to recount
humorous stories from his childhood and verbal expressions of his love for us. Ultimately it
claimed his life, long before it should have ended. In spite of this, Alzheimer's Disease cannot
and will not dull our memories of a man who humbly and honorably taught two boys how to be an
excellent father by his example.

I hope each of you enjoys Father's Day as much as I enjoy _remembering summers with Dad_.

## Outdoor adventures

Dad loved the outdoors and shared this enthusiasm with us each summer, spending quality time with
us as we explored various outdoor hobbies and sports. Dad was a gifted athlete, skilled in
baseball, basketball, golf and numerous other sports. I appreciate how he encouraged us but never
forced us to play a particular sport. In today's world, fathers often push their children to follow
in their footsteps in order to recapture their youth. Dad took a different approach.  He devoted
himself into helping us experience several new activities, such as showing us how to catch a fish
or how to hit a baseball. He knew the best balance of encouragement and instruction to help us
find our own hobbies and paths to success.

Each year, my Dad and Granddad planted a large vegetable garden with rows of asparagus, okra,
pumpkins, watermelon, cantaloupe, green beans, and sometimes corn. When Mark and I were old enough
to help with manual labor, we joined Dad and Granddad watering and pulling weeds in the garden
during the long, hot days of summer. At the time, both of us complained about this hard work, but
Dad knew that it would teach us larger lessons about life itself - the value of working hard so
you can enjoy a harvest. I look back at this time fondly, and I credit those lessons to my own
work ethic today.

One of our favorite activities in the summer was playing golf at Adams Municipal Golf Course
in Bartlesville.  Granddad and Dad had so many years of experience playing golf, and it showed.
Not only had they mastered the game, but they understood the subtle points of golf etiquette
which were often lost on Mark and I. They would kindly show us how to mark our ball position on
the green, how to avoid walking on the green between the pin and another player's ball, and
how to yell "fore!" to warn other players when one of our shots went astray, a common occurrence.
Most of all, golf was a way to make personal connections with Dad and Granddad. We heard their
stories about learning golf, lamented or celebrated the current state of the Oklahoma State
football team, and discussed nuggets of wisdom and humor as we walked the course together in the
blazing Oklahoma sun.

## Hamburgers, ice cream, and slideshows

To me, the highlight of every summer was undoubtedly the celebration of Independence Day and the
coinciding visits by aunts, uncles, and cousins. Our house often became the hub for these family
reunions, and my Mom and Dad were gracious hosts.  Mom always prepared her famous baked beans
and potato salad to go along with the best hamburgers. Dad had the honor of grilling the burgers, perhaps with a little bit of help from his sons, and cranking (for what seemed hours) the homemade
ice cream maker. The food was fantastic, and laughter always filled the house.

As the last bowls of ice cream were being consumed, Dad prepared the slide projector for the grand
finale - a photographic recap of our family's past year including birthdays, holidays, and
vacations. In the days of sharing photos on Instagram and Facebook, I now miss the quaint
click-click of the slide projector and the accompanying "oohs", "ahs" and laughter as we
celebrated another year with family. Dad's smiles indicated that knew the importance of family.

## Star-gazing and Star Trek

Summer days often concluded with star-gazing and Star Trek.

Dad, Mark, and I shared a love of astronomy and space exploration. As a youth, I could not read
enough books about the stars and planets, and I often tuned-in to NASA television news conferences
in which scientists discussed the latest findings and spectacular images from space probes such as
Voyager (exploring Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and Viking (landing on Mars).

Dad encouraged our love of astronomy by buying us a small telescope which allowed us to view with
our own eyes what we had seen in photos and on television. Seeing the rings of Saturn and the moons
of Jupiter through a our small telescope sparked my imagination and cemented my decision to pursue
science or engineering as a career.

I will never forget how Dad made a way for us to see Halley's Comet in 1986. Early one morning
before sunrise he drove us several miles east of town armed with binoculars and star maps hoping to
get a glimpse of the famous visitor to the night sky. Although the comet was fuzzy and faint,
two boys and one father shared an amazing experience that we will not forget.

Our love of astronomy and space exploration extended into fiction as well, and I can remember
spending many late nights as a teenager with Dad and Mark watching the original Star Trek re-runs
on television. Although these shows may seem "campy" to viewers today, we recognized the strong
stories and relevant messages that apply outside of the realm of science fiction. As I recall,
these late night viewings led to some of the first deep discussions with Dad about many of the
problems which face our world, even today.
