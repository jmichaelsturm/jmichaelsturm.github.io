For my brother and I, this is our first Father's Day without Dad, who passed away in March.
To be frank, over the course of several years Alzheimer's Disease slowly robbed each of us of
Dad's full presence long before his death in March.  At first it only slightly diminished his
exceptional intellect, giving the rest of us a fighting chance to win an occasional round of
Liverpool Rummy. As it progressed, this horrible illness stole his words and deprived him
of the ability to recount humorous stories from his childhood and verbal expressions of his love
for us. Ultimately it claimed his life, long before it should have ended. In spite of this,
Alzheimer's Disease cannot and will not dull our memories of a man who humbly and honorably
taught two boys how to be an excellent father by his example.

I hope each of you enjoys Father's Day as much as I enjoy _remembering summers with Dad_.
